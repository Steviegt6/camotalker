# camotalker
A Powercord plugin that surrounds your messages with zero-width unicode characters; useful for getting around automatic bot restrictions or hiding your messages from built in search.

You *must* enable this manually using `.camotoggle` (or you can choose to camouflage a specific message with `.camouflage [message]`). You can choose to de-camouflage an automatically-camouflaged message with `.decamouflage [message]`.

This is not an offical plugin due to its obvious "malicous" intended behaviour.
